**Setting**: Basement of [[Eero's House]] (Post [[Greg]] Fight)

- We're currently in the Basement of [[Eero's House]], where I see Mythril Veins anchored to the floor using [[Sovereign Glue]]
- This is post-[[Greg]] Fight so we look through magic items. 
	- *“[[Greg]] piped large amounts of modified [[Sovereign Glue]] all throughout his system for so long, it fused much of the magic items and materials that comprised his form into a new, unique type of Ore that has as of yet unknown properties.  It thrums with magic, resonates with strange energies, and seems to have latent yet rebellious sentience -- it may be an interesting material to work with, but before you can process it, you’ll have to unstick it from the floor.” – Griffin*
- After this, [[Ichorus]] sends out his guys. During this, we notice that the house was set in panic mode. 
	- In this mode, instead of panels, there exists a keyhole
	- We do notice that there are about 5-ish guys stalking the perimeter of the house
	- We notice that there is an 8th Level Forcefield placed around the house, but powered by what? 
- I explore the house a little bit. The most notable things are that there's an off-gray button next to the mirror, and I click it, causing the reflection to talk back at me and as me questions: 
	- What is our mothers name?
		- Marques Blythe. 
		- **MOTHERS MAIDEN NAME: SMITH**
	- Shortly after we escaped the abyss, we were hanging out with [[Tenebris]]… 
		- Melis
	- When you first went to the [[Kingdom of Shikiran]], you purchased stock in these spells… 
		- Wish and Air Bubble. CHAINSAW.
	- When I first incarnated into [[Ezekiel]] what was your first weapon? 
		- +1 longsword FUCK
	- This is the way to get the Mythril Key for Lockdown
- As I walk around, I finally get to the big section: 
	- *I check underneath the bed, and I see a small little trap door right in the center. Black space descending downwards. I true sight it, faint rope ladder descending into. Feather falling, and I descend down. The first thing that hits me is an intense mercury scent. Then, is a polished, white smooth floor. Looking through the gem, there’s a wall to my left and a lever. Then there’s a dimly lit laboratory. Various alchemist tools and chemists equipment, thick red, brackish liquid and blue plasma substance that continues past my range. Flood lights turn on as I hit the lever, I wince at them. I look down and look through and find some rhyme or reason, large experimental laboratory. Something way above my current pay grade. Way down, all the way at the end, there’s a large engine of sorts. It’s a massive glass construction that’s producing thick soupy red (blood like) and blood plasma that’s mixing that’s pumping out of this room. There’s syringes, equipment, scissors, scalpels, machines, wiring so small… ornate tiny hands… arcane prongs, made of metal that looks out of this world… adrift in the middle of that, I see a man in the vat. Old, and gray. Tangled, gray hair, three different hair styles. Right-side is a solider like man. In the middle is parts of an older gentleman, chest is partly open, lungs. Left side is a female, delicate, talented and dexterous. I can see the lungs have been reinforced with air filters, bones have been plated over, corners of the eyes have been replaced with binocular settings. All old. Spewing out viscera and mixing with the plasma. Growing older, growing weaker.*
	- No stitches (perfectly mends together). 
	- This is powering the house but also powering something else… Very small portion is being recycled into the house. There’s more that’s going somewhere else. 
	- IM GONNA USE THE COAT - I put on the coat and there’s more PLASMA like me pumping into your mom. I take off coat. More than 4x is pumping out. Prolly 10 x the amount of pumping.
	- THIS IS THE SAME PLACE THAT FUTURE EERO WAS MAKING THE SHIT AND WEARING THE TEMPORAL COAT. When I put on the coat, the person inside my power source begins to degrade. When future Eero was wearing it, it did nothing to the power source. Distance is not a problem. When I shifted nothing happened.
	- No notes around but I see implements (alchemy tools that exist in deep history and some futuer ones.) No dust in the room. Sterile environment, (deliciously clean), i see tool sthat require humanoid input. I see tools that suggest someone would be in the room to work w them. I open up draweres, and eventually I go to the back corner of the room to a desk. This has a cover (enclosed desk). I would typically need a lock but instead there’s a small rectangular panel where a keyhole or lock should be. With a 37 INV, I reach out and touch and as I bring my finger back, theres a panel of interweaving lines (finger print is left behind), it rolls back, journals, appears, cup of coffee. ITS WARM. Brewed in the last… 20 minuets. 

  

I PUT ON COAT AND CAST A NEW PELL: DETECT TEMPORAL ANOMOLY. Everything I scan (the part of the room, the lights, the EVERYTHING, is a temporal anomaly) I CONCENTRATE TO SEE THE SEVERITY.
