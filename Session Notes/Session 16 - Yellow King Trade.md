### Current Session Notes: 
Setting: [[Fields of Thrain]]. 

- [[Tenebris]] teleports us to his demi-plane, which is sort of an extension of the [[Yellow City]]
- We planned to trade [[The Book of Hells]] to garner the attention of the [[Yellow King]]
- We encounter the [[13 Messengers of Hastor]] 
	- *“We’ve been having problems with the hells ever since you, in our name, broke one of our infernal contracts.”* 
	- The Yellow Messengers were created as [[God Candidate]]s by the [[Yellow King]], which are separate from Eldritch beings wanting to become an Eldritch God. 
- When we encounter the [[Yellow King]], I choose not to step up to him since it will cause problems due to my mortal status 
	- Meanwhile, transferred the coat to [[Tenebris]] 
	- I was detected as a *Chronomancer* by the [[Yellow King]] 
		- *NOTE: This is surprising to me. Why would I be labeled as such, even without the coat?*
	- The death of [[Amaadon]] was reported. The King's response is: 
		- Recently, a Fledgling Eldritch Being and [[God Candidate]] have died there. They’re the only thing that have died near the Tree site in the [[Fields of Thrain]]. ([[Amaadon]]’s death was not detected.) 
		- [[Yellow King]]: *What favor are you trying to curry? 
		- [[Tenebris]]: *"I would like knowledge on how to become a [[God Candidate]]. If not possible, I would like my bond with my real Koshek that provides a stronger bond than the recent familiar ritual."*
		- [[Yellow King]]: *"You wish to be a [[God Candidate]]. Do you wish to be a [[God Candidate]] or MY [[God Candidate]]?"*
	- The [[Yellow King]] notes something about interacting with [[Cthulhu (The Great Dreamer)]] and his Bound Prophet, the [[Watcher in the Rain]]
	- The [[Yellow King]] admits that he created [[Tenebris]] for the sake of being a messenger to the Hells. ==His early memories were most likely fabricated. ==
- We no longer have the [[The Book of Hells]].
