**Setting:** [[Eero's House]] 
- THE BOOK IS THE GOLDEN TIMELINE? 
	- *NOTE: I have no fucking clue what this really means. 9.5.25 Conrad*
- We’re trying to figure out the decay of the power source of the house
	- I cast [[Hourglasses]] to see into the future. 
		- One day goes by, we all leave and do go back in. Very next day, [[Tenebris]] comes back inside and he starts, sits down in the middle room, for the next week, he starts training. 10 weeks go by. Eventually, at the 12th week point, he leaves and comes back in. The couch opens up at 12th week mark. Disgruntled [[Ruin]], goes outside. 
	- I see [[Ichorus]]' Sword then it gets blurry. 13th week, the hour glasses can’t tell what happens next. Starts branching out.
	- **41 week mark**, perfectly spherical crater where my house used to be. BAD. (this is with a coat on, which speeds up the decay process)
- Find out what’s being powered by the generator? Also can we see the chronomancy chamber w/o the lock down, as in to say, it still exists. 
- We found out that **the guy** commanding people outside is the same guy that gave sentience to [[Greg]]. They seem to not be making any noise at all. Well maintained weapons, something of a magical order, very skilled. Turns out, the people around us are related to the [[Brantafax Family]]
- Using my [[Haste Beacon]], we'll look for items through the pile of rubbish left by [[Greg]]
- We get these items: 
	- [[Miniature Steam Engine]]
	- 18 Ingots of Glass steel
	- 22 Ingots of Baatorian Steel
	- 13 Ingots of Mind Iron
	- 19 Ingots of Abyssal Blood iron
- Using these items, we make the ALLOY!! We use the forge in the back of the room. **We melt down 24 ingots of adamantium slab.** 
- In the forge, we see a little wooden sculpture. I touch it. I feel the wood of it grow back, little embers flick off the sides of it. There's a singe on my finger. I hear in the back of my head (more behind me), *“Oh, hello [[Eero]]. It’s been a hot second since we’ve made something.”*
- This is [[The Angel of the Forge]], and what I sacrifice dictates how good the forge works: 
	1. Normally, permits Mythril Grade use
	2. Life energy, permits God Steel use
	3. Blood Magic but more permanent. Life sacrifice -> two years. I typically gave up of my own. (Me.) They didn’t taste as good as my life. 
- I grab the obelisk. First thing I notice: not a cursed spirit. The fire is golden in origin which is more like a **celestial bound** to my forge. 
- MAX HP is now 194. 
- We liquify the adamantium. 4 Ingots of the goop will be for the alloy. The other 20 will be kept for other ingots. 
- We use 4 ingots of gilded meteorite steel and melt that bad boy down to make an alloy.
- 33 for a smith tools. I get 8 alloys of a 50/50 ratio of adamantium and gilded meteorite steel. Almost as strong as adamantium and has divine receptibility but the meteorite steel’s fire property is now gone and lost it’s critical cancel. 
- Two draconic runes etch themselves into the palms of my hands. They seem… vial in origin. Torture like. 
	- One is rune for war, one is rune for divine. 
- [[Draconic Blessing of the Forge]]: You gain access to the wellspring of energy stemming from Kuyutha’s War Chest. The next weapon you create forms a crystallization of divine power, borrowed from Kereska’s vestigial hoard, turning the weapon into a lesser vestige. This is not Kuyutha’s divine power, as it is seized from an unknown source. The resulting vestige is identical to the blueprint it was made under but is now in a dormant state. The Dragon God shall determine the awakened state, as well as the awakening catalyst, and the destruction requirements.
- We must cover [[Ichorus]]’ thing with his divine ichor. 30 on surgical tools, this passes. 28 on frame of the sword. 
- During the creation of the sword, we get some great successes: 
	- Clean Syphon: 
		- First round of combat, Hemocraft abilities don’t cause self harm. 
	- Expansive Storage 
		- Instead of being able to hold ¼ of the health 
		- It is able to hold ⅓ of the health
- "I USE GREGS LEFT TESTICLE TO POWER THE HASTE BEACON AND END UP WITH 3 MORE USES."
- I attach [[Orys]]'s hellish arm. 
	- Any damage from [[Orys]] dealt to us heals us 
	- He shoots [[Ichorus]]! 41 + 49 -> Healing 90 points 
- 2 CHARGES OF HASTE BEACON 
- More searching: 
	- 30 Ingots of Mythril (added) 
- [[Ruin]] is coming out in a week and we go to The [[Locations/Kingdom of Shikiran]] for the eldritch gate. Sitting in front of it is [[Sunstar]], [[Kurst]], [[Brugal]] and [[Kayashi]], [[Jam]],
