You gain access to the wellspring of energy stemming from Kuyutha’s War Chest. The next weapon you create forms a crystallization of divine power, borrowed from Kereska’s vestigial hoard, turning the weapon into a lesser vestige. This is not Kuyutha’s divine power, as it is seized from an unknown source. The resulting vestige is identical to the blueprint it was made under but is now in a dormant state. The Dragon God shall determine the awakened state, as well as the awakening catalyst, and the destruction requirements.
