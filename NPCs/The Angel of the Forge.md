Also known as Imperialis Gorthrain. The Angel that powers my forge. 

### Hierarchy of Items:
 What I sacrifice dictates how good the forge works: 
1. Normally, permits Mythril Grade use
2. Life energy, permits God Steel use
3. Blood Magic but more permanent. Life sacrifice -> two years. I typically gave up of my own. (Me.) They didn’t taste as good as my life.
