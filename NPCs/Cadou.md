*The Fallen Angel against [[Ezekiel]] for some fucking reason.*

He's a high-level flame-based sorcerer who's dexterous and has the ability to teleport.  

### Lore: 
According to some information gotten in [[Candlekeep]] with [[Steven Sparker]]'s help, we know this much: 
- Started out as an Angel and chosen of the previous Sun God before he was eaten by [[Asmodeus]] for Godhood. Because of this, he was pissed but had no ability to go down to hell (to gain revenge?), so he wiped out a country in the [[Armageddon Desert]] and fell from grace as a result of his genocide. This resulted in him becoming a Fallen Angel. 
- Similar to how [[Ezekiel]] works, he can make fire duplicates of himself and has become more malevolent.
