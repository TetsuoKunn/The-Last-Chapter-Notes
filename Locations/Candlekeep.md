A bastion of knowledge, a facility to worship the God of Knowledge, [[Denear]].

We once stayed here to get knowledge on a couple things. Notably, [[Ichorus]] got information on [[Amaadon]], I got some information on [[Cadou]], and found out that I shouldn't explore the [[Brantafax Family]]. 

### Lore: 
- Mary Ann, a librarian, once went to research the [[Brantafax Family]] and it resulted in her returning and revoking her vow and formally leaving [[Candlekeep]]
